# pUber
Android app making is possible to share toilets in the same way Uber makes it possible to "share" your car.

This application was developed at a smartphone development course at Aarhus University.

The application communicates with Firebase making it possible to create a user, 
attach a toilet to that user and to request to use other users' toilets.

The app uses resource externalization.
